Calendar todo:

timeCombo

- needs to modify a model date object

- save previous value to controller model so we can compare if anything changed
  and if value is invalid we can restore last good value.

- listen for enter key when textbox gets focus. remove listener on blur.

- when item is selected from list OR input textbox is blurred or enter pressed in textbox
  if current value is different from previous value
    try to parse string into hours, minutes and set to model date object.
    
    if parse fails... add regex validator to verify that time is of format (0-24):
    maybe set input to previous value
