Calendar todo:


[] create jm-my-calendar directive for individual calendars

[] add 'create new' action to 'my calendars' container dropdown



- popup options
  - create separate modal for each use case.
     for repeating items this will mean a modal for each on the page.

     try creating this and if it is workable make a directive for it so we can transclude content.


  - create global popup
    on click of element call service to ask modal to show:
     - buttons with function to call when clicked.
     - title (if any).
     - form elements {type,name,placeholder}
     - position?
