Calendar todo:

Bugs:
  [x] Edit event doesn't show selected calendar in select.

  [] color picker doesn't close when calendar edit form submitted. Can we close it on blur?


Features:
  [] Change mycalendar name to General and set defaultFlag on it in case they make another one called 'general'
  [] put shown calendars at top of list in calendar edit.
  [] sort calendars by name but 'General' is at top.


Make calendarEvents have a ranges property and act like a cache so we don't fetch events
if we don't need to.

Enable collapsing of left/right panels.

Can we put start/end time on same line?

Make event text not show | cursor when hovered over. I think this is done by making it not selectable in css.

Make full/multi-day events show '<' at start of continued week and '>' at continuing week end.

Show previous/next month date number in gray or add background color for all
   dates and make it different for prev/next.


[x] Calendar edit modal should show edit/create in title as appropriate.

[x] Clicking on event shows event details with 'edit', 'delete' links.

[x]When events don't fit into calendar view show 'more events' element.

[x] create popup for more events
  - show popup with all events listed as links to the normal edit/delete popup.
  - show all days first with border then show partials with time/title.

[x] To do that I might need to make a directive for the calendar edit modal.

[x]Make partial day events show no background and no border in text.

[x] Remove l/r borders from day names table.

[x] Add small left margin for day numbers.

[x] move the monthly calendar view model code into the monthly calendar directive.

[x] my-calendars list not showing now.

[x] Enable hiding/showing calendar events.

[x] Allow setting colors for calendars.

[x] Make bootstrap selector for calendar edit 'Calendar' select.

[x] Don't put cursor in event title for event edit popup
