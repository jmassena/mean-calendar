Calendar todo:

[x] Calendar edit modal should show edit/create in title as appropriate.

[x] Clicking on event shows event details with 'edit', 'delete' links.

[x]When events don't fit into calendar view show 'more events' element.

[*] create popup for more events
  - show popup with all events listed as links to the normal edit/delete popup.
  - show all days first with border then show partials with time/title.

Can I move the monthly calendar view model code into the monthly calendar directive?

To do that I might need to make a directive for the calendar edit modal.

Make partial day events show no background and no border in text.

Make full/multi-day events show '<' at start of continued week and '>' at continuing week end.

Show previous/next month date number in gray or add background color for all
   dates and make it different for prev/next.


Remove l/r borders from day names table.

Add small left margin for day numbers.

Allow setting colors for calendars.

Enable hiding/showing calendar events.

Enable collapsing of left/right panels.


Can we put start/end time on same line?

Make bootstrap selector for calendar edit 'Calendar' select.

Make event text not show | cursor when hovered over. I think this is done by making it not selectable in css.
