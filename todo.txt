Calendar todo:


This is the hard part.

Create view model that has column span information already calculated.

for each day
  for each event
    record daysInWeekSpan for first event in week.
    repeat event for each day event is on and mark as isInterWeekContinuation
    so we don't render anything for it.

    repeat event for each week that event is in.
    record isContinuedFromLastWeek, isContinuedNextWeek, isInterWeekContinuation


Then when we render we can use these indicators for:
  daysInWeekSpan: colspan.
  isInterWeekContinuation do not render
  isContinuedNextWeek: style right border like >
  isContinuedFromLastWeek: style left border like <
